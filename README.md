# Firmware for the Zyxel U100-MULTI

Zyxel U100-MULTI with baby jumbo frames (1508) support enabled.

The baby jumbo frame change and the firmware binary have been tested on several U100 models units with success but you apply it to your own equipment at your own risk. This software is provided "as is," without warranty of any kind, express or implied. In no event shall the author or contributors be held liable for any damages arising in any way from the use of this software.

## Instructions

1. You must use the 32-bit version of [Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS Desktop](http://releases.ubuntu.com/12.04/) to build this firmware. Using anything else is likely to cause buildroot to fail and generate nothing or a broken firmware image.

2. Run `sudo apt-get update`

3. Run `sudo dpkg-reconfigure dash` and select no.

4. Install necessary tools with `sudo apt-get install -y g++ flex bison gawk make autoconf zlib1g-dev libncurses-dev git subversion gettext`

5. Clone this repo somewhere.

6. Change to cloned repo directory.

7. Run `make dirclean`

8. Run `make`

9. The complete firmware image is bin/brcm963xx/zyxel/ras.bin and should be roughly 28MB.

## Flashing instructions

Flash the .bin file via the Maintenance -> Firmware Upgrade menu in the web UI. You'll need to log in as admin or supervisor.

If the Firmware Upgrade option is not available then you can use FTP instead to upload the firmware even if you only know the admin password. Check that FTP is enabled in Maintenance -> Remote Management. Transfer the .bin into the fw directory and it should immediately apply the upgrade then reboot. Make sure it is using binary mode when transferring the .bin file.

```

```

If you can't use the Firmware Upgrade page and can't enable FTP on the Remote Management page then you'll need to open the router to use the 3.3V LVTTL console port to gain access to the bootloader. The connections are clearly marked on the PCB. Make sure your serial adapter is 3.3V as 5V or RS232 levels will damage it. The instructions for this are detailed elsewhere. The ATSE model is VMG3926 instead of VMG3925.

## Binaries

Precompiled firmware is on the releases page.

If you wish to revert to the stock firmware then download it from Zyxel and reflash it using the web interface.

## Original source

You can request the VMG3925-B10B firmware source yourself from Zyxel using their [GPL source request form](https://www.zyxel.com/us/en/form/gpl_oss_form.shtml). You'll need the serial number from your VMG3925-B10B to do so. The initial commit to this repo is the unmodified firmware source with an additional README.md file. Thanks to kabalin for [posting the instructions on how to verify the source](https://github.com/trejan/VMG3925-B10B/issues/1#issuecomment-426970503).

0. Introduction

  This file will show you how to build the VMG3925-B10B linux system,
  please note, the download image will overwrite the original image existed in the flash memory of EV board.


1. Files list

   A. README					- This file

   B. V513AAVF12C0_GPL.tar.bz2	- Open Source Code of VMG3925-B10B and Open Source Code of Toolchain


2. Prepare the build OS.

   A. We suggest using the Linux distribution to setup your environment for reduce compatible issue.

	Install Ubuntu 12.04 Desktop 32bit

   B. Update system

       Use GUI interface to update system or use command to update system.

	$ sudo apt-get update
	
   *Note: If update failed, edit /etc/apt/sources.list as following link
	deb http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise main
	deb-src http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise main
	deb http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise-updates main

   C. Change default /bin/sh link to /bin/bash

	$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure dash
	choice "no" and press enter.


3. Prepare the compiler environment

   Install the following necessary tools
